# ============================================================
# AI Hardcoded Wave Definitions
# ============================================================
# Each entry defines an army the AI will send when the
# defender matches ALL trigger conditions.
#
# Entries are evaluated IN ORDER.  The LAST matching entry
# wins  (most-specific entries should go last).
# If no entry matches, the adaptive heuristic is used.
#
# ── Trigger fields (all optional, default = always true) ────
#   buildings:   list of building IIDs that must ALL be
#                completed by the defender (remaining_effort == 0)
#   knowledge:   list of knowledge IIDs that must ALL be
#                completed by the defender
#   citizen:    defender must have at least this much citizens of ANY type
#
# ── Army fields ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#   critter:  critter IID (matched case-insensitively)
#   slots:    number of critters in this wave
#
# ── Example ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
